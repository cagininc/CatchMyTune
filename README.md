# üé∂ Catch My Tune


The **Song Analysis** feature of the Catch My Tune application provides a seamless backend process for automatically analyzing songs as soon as they are uploaded to the system. Leveraging **Librosa**, a popular Python library for audio analysis, this feature extracts valuable musical characteristics, including **tempo** and **key**,**loudness**, providing meaningful insights for the user.

Upon uploading a song, the system automatically triggers the analysis pipeline:
- **Tempo Detection**: The tempo of the song is computed using Librosa's beat tracking capabilities, offering users a precise **beats-per-minute (BPM)** measure for the uploaded track.
- **Key Detection**: Using chroma feature extraction, the system approximates the **musical key** of the track. This initial implementation gives a basic understanding of the key, suitable for further refinement.
- **Database Integration**: The analysis results are stored directly in the **PostgreSQL database**, allowing users to access the enriched metadata whenever needed.
-Providing **LUFS-based** loudness data in Catch My Tune enables musicians and producers to ensure consistent audio levels, delivering professional-quality tracks that meet industry standards and enhance the listener experience.
The goal is to provide musicians, producers, and enthusiasts with **immediate insights** into their uploaded music, enhancing their experience and helping them understand their tracks in more detail. This feature aligns with industry best practices for automation, using **Django's backend** to ensure each song is processed effectively, while leveraging Librosa for high-quality analysis.

We are continually looking to improve the analysis, aiming to provide more detailed characteristics in future iterations.
